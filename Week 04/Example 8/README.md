# Example 8
**Step 1 - Introduction** <br/>

Five switches (A,B, C, D, and E) are connected to ATmega328p as shown
below. The microcontroller needs to keep track of how many times each
button has been pressed. Whenever any button has been pressed, the
microcontroller needs to send out the information (of how many times
each button has been pressed) through the serial port. Program the
microcontroller to accomplish this.
